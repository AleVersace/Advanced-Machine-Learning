# Advanced Machine Learning

Personal activities (laboratories and other exercises) related to the course 'Advanced Machine Learning' @ PoliTO. (Still ongoing)

## Description

### Main topics 

Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Task and Structured Output Learning (Semantic Segmentation and Detection) [...].

### Table of contents

Main Topic | Content | Dataset 
--- | --- | --- 
CNN Tutorial Pytorch | [CIFAR10 Pytorch Tutorial](./CIFAR10_Classifier.ipynb) | CIFAR10
CNN with dataset class from scratch | [Flowers-102 from scratch](./Flowers102/) | Flowers-102  
CNN + Transfer Learning | [Caltech101 on AlexNet/ResNet](./Caltech101/) | Caltech101
LSTM + convLTSM | [GTEA61 on LSTM](./LSTM_spatial_info.ipynb) | GTEA61

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3
* Pytorch
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

### Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:AleVersace/Advanced-Machine-Learning.git
```

### Executing program tips

* I strongly suggest to work on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Use Google Colab if you plan to train from scratch and/or your pc hasn't a powerful enough GPU.
